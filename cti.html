<h3>Dirtbag | Chipping Sodbury </h3> 

I read Amber A’lee Frost’s Dirtbag in a fitting context - three in the morning on a Monday on an e-reader taking a bath to try to alleviate 
an acutely painful fever, at one point cracking a beer in the wee hours (which I of course do not recommend for a fever or for many other things,
 but, well, there you have it). It’s a collection of essays/ memoir from a person prominent in the American online left over the past decade 
 (I was not), who was active in Occupy Wall Street and in the Bernie Sanders campaigns (I was not), on a subculture-famous bro-podcast 
 (that I have never listened to, but whose logo is that of the American Drug Enforcement Administration’s Cocaine Intelligence Unit, which led 
 me down a small 
 <a href= "https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/mar/16/DEA-patches/">{rabbit hole}</a> 
  of other drug-related official insignia the creative minds in the US federal government have come up, 
 which I recommend). 
 <br> <br>
As a book, I feel mixed about it. As perennial outsider, I find peering into other worlds both hella fun and somehow important.
 I am (hopefully?) not quite terminally online, but the internet has turned out to be pivotal to my life, and I can very much get the
  appeal of its weirder corners. There was a brief moment pre-Elon when Twitter was genuinely fun for me, and I even met some very dear 
  real-life friends there, bizarrely, against the backdrop of the usual disjointed infinite scroll. I am interested in a viable American left,
   and so is Frost, and she can put her money where her mouth is far better than I, and her grumpiness is very welcome. She efficiently 
   underscores the difference between the performative aspects of American liberalism and an actual left politics that is interested in 
   material conditions (unionized labour, accessible healthcare). My favourite parts of the book were those that dealt with her personal 
   experience — she has a distinctive and engaging way of summarizing where she came from and is going. This  
   <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Tke6OCdCzic3ASxhsBEWo/">{interview}</a>
   about the book was an enjoyable listen  (and contains the sentence NYU is basically a real estate venture with a side hustle in 
   education, which is deeply relatable to some universities I went to, and explains a lot). 
   <br> <br>
However, the book doesn’t quite hang together - it’s a series of essays, some of which have been published before, but the overarching point
 didn’t quite land for me (again, I read it at 3 in the morning, feverish). She warns at the outset that she has ADHD and so the voice may be 
 meandering, which is a forever problem of going for a beer with some people (me), but I don’t think is an excuse for not organizing the thing 
 that you’re writing. At points she is vulgar just for fun and it doesn’t entirely work for me. But the disjointed insights, grossness and all, 
 are still, I think, worth reading - a testament to a specific place and time in the American subconscious. It’s not my vantage point, and it
  didn’t work out, and it might not ever, but nevertheless, a witness. 
  <br> <br>
{A sizeable amount of the people who were actively interested in a viable American left went post-ironic right, which is a
   <a href= "https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/57309/1/edgelords-far-right-views-kanye-west-dimes-square-urbit">{fascinating phenomenon}</a>
   and also frankly a failure of any number of things. An ongoing question for many people I know is how to stay engaged with the world without burning out. 
   Some pretty profoundly stupid judicial and legislative things happened in Czechia this month, of the sort that are both viscerally 
   painful and that I remember being angry about over a decade ago. An (as-usual-entirely-precise) friend once remarked that in Czechia an
    extra frustrating thing happens in these situations - in the case of a disagreement between two sides with an unequal power dynamic, 
    bystanders will say “oh, just don’t fight, it’s not worth it”, and “be reasonable”. For me, expressing any emotion at all in public 
    has historically borne the risk of dismissal and condescension, and I am accordingly careful of where I invest emotional energy. 
    I’m furthermore not interested in activism as identity, and, well, it’s none of our first times around this particular block. 
    <br> <br>
    So the question becomes - how to keep engaging? In private, you can write the people responsible emails about how they are failures,
     but that has limited effect & also is probably a bad habit to get into. I haven’t solved it, but I have been
    finding, not for the first time, that 
     really actively enjoying and noticing everyday life — walks, trees, dogs, friends, terrible jokes, pubs, music —
     besides being well worth doing in its own right,
      actively helps in finding a stable place from which to do any number of things, including difficult conversations. 
      Furthermore it’s a practice that can be trained. Get stoked, get organized? 
      (It's of course far from a new idea. Among many, the somewhat-pathetic-but-on-point 
      <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvu87DwV3nY">{dance scene}</a>
      from a somewhat pathetic film that I quite like shares that sentiment.)}
      <br> <br>
I’m back in England, and it's very nice. I had a work meeting in Bristol and took the opportunity to cycle there from Stroud, where
I saw a sound-as-hell friend that I haven't seen in years, rolling sheep meadows, marginally too many pints of ale, 
 many good dogs, etc. I passed a sign 
for Chipping Sodbury and was reminded of 
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_g_n_SxVgc">{this}</a>
great song by John Cale, which has inspired a minor John Cale listening kick. 
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDyAJhoMzb8">{So great.}</a>

<h3>Ducks | Fallen Leaves </h3> 

Ducks is Kate Beaton’s comic memoir about two years in the Alberta tar sands. 
The migration is a familiar one in Canada - people from poorer provinces (the Maritimes) go to west to make bank 
in the oil industry. So did an early-twenties Kate, paying off student loans. The book is a visual diary - drawn scenes 
from two years of a life, a constantly shifting background of characters, snippets of conversation, short snapshots, 
longer ones. Cold, space, coffee, snow, hard hats, giant machines, fly-in labour camps, drawn in monochrome. No narrative, 
just testimony at a specific place and time. Isolation, alienation, corporate alibism, brutal interpersonal situations, extractive 
dynamics, and also, sometimes, flashes of gentle human ones. It’s the most Canadian reckoning I’ve read this year 
and I very much recommend it. 

    <br> <br>
I know northern Alberta, a bit, from several years in a different remote fly-in manual labour job (silviculture,
 or manually replanting the clearcuts: sustainability in action). Planting trees is is of course very different 
 from oil sands work: it’s seasonal, and the demographic is mostly people in their twenties and thirties, 
 often funding university degrees. Women are a minority, but not always a drastic one, and few of us expected to do it 
 for thirty years. The exhaustion and satisfaction that came from doing a brutally difficult job well was maybe 
 transferable, as was the sense of fighting the physical landscape - lighting waxed boxes in June snowstorms to keep 
 warm, winching Ford F-350’s out of bogs, interminable miles of hostile logging road, dirt under dirt. For me, an 
 immigrant from central Europe, it was the first time I saw the landscape bulk of Canada: the Canada that was, and is,
  built on resource extraction. I was visiting it, as, ultimately, was Beaton. I think her report back will be taught in 
  secondary schools. It should be.
  <br> <br>
Important in Ducks is an account of assaults. That happened in silviculture too, and elsewhere, multiple times; not to me.
 The man was inevitably never charged; fired, sometimes, but often not, and has a name and an address and all of the women 
 who were there know it, and as often as not continues life as an Ontario golden boy with a guitar. (I realized, maybe 
 surprisingly recently, that one of the big projects of my life (how-to-be-and-why) was to continue to feel and recognize 
 anger and to react to the world that produces it but to not let it become part of my being-ness.)
 Implicit in Ducks is the question of to what extent the 
 disassociation forms the people, or vice versa, etc, — more important is the story. Read Ducks.
 <br> <br>
 (I know Kate Beaton because someone great introduced me to her very silly, very great 
 <a href= " http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=186">{historical webcomic}</a> in university. Recommended.)
 <br> <br>

Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki’s new film, reminded me of Ducks in its scissor-cut scene quality. The plot isn’t the point: 
briefly, two people in Finland meet, and then fail to meet again, and then fail to meet again again (and then meet, maybe). 
The point are the scenes, which are perfectly composed, the triumphantly bleak humour, the staying power, the subdued 
surrealism, the excellent dog, the washed out bright colours, the wry eyebrows. It won all the awards at Cannes and elsewhere, 
which makes sense. In theory it is a darkly funny film about bleak situations; in practice it cheered me up more 
than most things these past weeks. As my friend Kit says - keep up the persistence.

    <h3>Winds of november, nostalgia for an imagined past</h3> 


    Many unfinished reading notes this month. I read From Russia With Love and found it very funny
   in unintentional ways (the head of the Russian secret service is bisexual and it gives her arcane
    and terrifying powers (as opposed to a general ambivalence/ inability to sit still), the main plot 
    twist is that the pride and joy of the British secret service voluntarily gives his gun to the first
     undercover Russian operative he meets and gets shot in short order, etc etc.). 
     The style is very elegant at points in the sort of Eton way, but I’m reminded that nostalgia and 
     preoccupation with style -to which I probably have a tendency- are not neutral positions (something something Kissinger, 
     something something hagiographies). I also read some things that were good, but still processing on that front. 

     <br> <br>
     Speaking of nostalgia for an imagined past - it’s the last day before Advent and so, 
     atmospherically, somehow, the last day to listen to <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prOxLY1DCo">this</a>
     (and of course <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp_TcDVs3Uo">{the Song that November Taught Me}</a>). 
     Dude from Czechoslovakia writing songs in the 1980s imagining sailing on the Hudson Bay ships. 
     I heard it in childhood and came across it again unexpectedly recently, and the vibe is dark, 
     cold, vast, and frankly impeccable, pan flutes included. (I was trying to explain to Canadian friends 
     that starting at the beginning of the 20th century there was (and still is) is a whole contingent 
     of people in the centre of Europe going into the woods behind town on the weekends and pretending to 
     be in the Canadian north. It deserves a longer explanation and I’m not the one to give it, but it’s a 
     thing I have time for, from a few directions. Anyway, we may try to put together a radio show in Toronto
      of Czech songs about the Canadian north. Send me your tips if you have them.)

    <h2>2023-10-16 | Mr. Salary (test)</h2>  
    <h3>or, love won't save you</h3>   
    
    I recently read Sally Rooney’s first ever short story, published 2016 - Mr. Salary. 
  Smart, vaguely troubled woman in care of / correspondence with self-posessed somewhat older man. 
  Understated gestures about inner screaming. Happy ends, sort of.
  <br> 
  Like many people Sally Rooney’s age (and, to some extent, general situation), 
  I very much enjoyed Normal People, and in almost equal measure 
  Conversations With Friends and Beautiful World, Where Are You.  
  She has a solid eye for interpersonal and societal structures and a sparsely conveyed electricity in correspondence (and sex). 
  She’s clever as hell and manages to be only sort of annoying about it, and at the same time manages to convey foundational, thoroughly unironic emotion,
    which I think is extremely difficult to do. Normal People is the last book in recent memory that made me sob unexpectedly. 
    <br>   <br>  
    And so it was only while reading Rooney’s first, maybe more direct, effort that I 
    realized what frustrates me about the whole thing - despite the clever social commentary and style, 
    despite the well-sketched will-they-won’t-they, despite emotional resonance, 
    there is an underlying premise of resolution and sublimation in all-absolving romantic love. 
    <br>   <br>  
    I am cheering for love, thoroughly, in all forms (I am, when it comes down to it, at points nigh-on irritatingly romantic after all; 
    it’s one of many reasons I can’t stand Milan Kundera). 
    Love in all forms creates the world, and anyone who tried to come up with a better overarching framework has failed as yet to convince me and moreover was typically a tech bro.
    Partnership is a deeply meaningful project to me; so are friendship and kinship and many forms of fellow-wandering. 
    It’s specifically the idea of love as deus ex machina that bugs me: love of all forms is the point and simultaneously 
    it will not magically solve things or absolve them and any piece of art that ends on that note falls short - of what exactly, I’m not sure. 
    <br>   <br>  
     (I recently had a conversation with a close friend of close friends whom I hadn’t met before and who lives in a different city, 
     which created a remarkable combination of trust and distance, and we talked over tea about intersubjectivity 
     and came to the conclusion that love won’t save you, and that that was a good thing. 
     The chat was a welcome safe pocket in an otherwise dreary, tense day). 
     <br>   <br>  
    (Of course Rooney’s books are more complicated, and have brilliant parts. There’s a point in 
    BWWAY when most tensions, romantic or otherwise, have been resolved and various people have 
    gotten their act together and one woman writes to the other something along the lines 
    of my partner seems to be generally content, he helps old people with their groceries these days,
    which lets him complain about old people, and makes compost at the community garden, which lets him complain about compost. Relatable, and hopeful.)
    <br>   <br>  
    Rooney’s essays about things other than love are brilliant, by the way. 
    Like her sharp, well researched, sensitive indictment of 
    <a href= "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/2023/03/18/sally-rooney-renters-are-being-exploited-and-evictions-must-be-stopped/">landlordism in Ireland</a> 
    (nicely taglined <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0p6eswIkQk">“The nice thing about being a landlord is you never run out of other people’s money”</a>).  
    Or her essay, <a href= "https://thedublinreview.com/article/even-if-you-beat-me/">even if you beat me</a> about competitive debate, 
    about the weirdness and hypocrisy dissonance of that world and also about what it actually means to pursue excellence.
    <br>   <br>  
    (I once had a car named Mackie, short for Deus ex Machina. One of the cylinders of his boxer engine started failing on the
     highway outside of Portland which was very far from where we had to go and my partner and 
     I learned a lot about boxer engines on wikipedia that trip. Mackie survived, barely, and was shortly thereafter sold to a retired airplane mechanic for parts.)

<h3>This is a reading diary</h3>  
  
Lately I spend quite a bit of time reading, but largely either someone's research paper on an obscure thing, or bad news 
or other people’s opinion on bad news (or Instagram captions). I would also like to read fiction, ideally fiction that I haven’t read before, 
or at least words that cannot be described by the first four categories, for fun. Notes may follow, here. (Maybe someday I will watch films!)
<br> 
I have a nebulous idea that it would be nice to write something here about the things I read for fun maybe once a month, but letting projects wilt is a 
fight against entropy that I tend to lose, and it's also possible that giving oneself fun-homework has inherent problems (but spirals can go upwards, too. We will see)
