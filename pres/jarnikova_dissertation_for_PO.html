The ocean is Earth's largest active reservoir of carbon.

--

The ocean's inorganic carbon content is set by interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes.

--

To understand how the ocean's carbon content is changing, we must first understand the contributions of these processes to the dynamic balance of the system.

Primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from 280 $\mu$atm to over 400 $\mu$atm since the industrial revolution.
        
--

The ocean has absorbed 20-30%$^1$ of the anthropogenic  emissions of CO$_2$ to date.

##Ocean Acidification: The Other CO$_2$ problem

Increasing CO$_2$ in the surface ocean due to uptake from atmosphere shifts the speciation kinetics of inorganic carbon in seawater: 

--

<div> CO$_{2(atmos)}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ CO$_{2(aq)}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ H$_{2}$CO$_{3}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ H$^{+}$ + HCO$_{3}^{-}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ 2H$^{+}$ + CO$_{3}^{2-}$ </div>

--
<br/>
<div> CO$_{2(aq)}$ $\uparrow$ means H$^{+}$ $\uparrow$, pH $\downarrow$, (CO$_{3}^{2-}$) $\downarrow$ </div>

--

This shift has been called ocean acidification$^1$.

A decrease in CO$_{3}^{2-}$ lowers the saturation state ($\Omega$) of CaCO$_3$ minerals, required for the growth of calcifying organisms:
--

<div> $\Omega = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][CO_{3}^{2-}]}{K'_{sp}}$ </div>

--

Below $\Omega$ = 1, dissolution of CaCO$_3$ is thermodynamically favoured.

--

Thus, high-resolution regional ocean models are uniquely poised 
to give insights into carbon cycling dynamics at the crucial coastal scale! 

--

In my doctoral work, I developed a submesoscale carbonate chemistry model for the Salish Sea and used it to
understand the changing inorganic carbon balance of this coastal ocean. 

--

Furthermore, our high-resolution model may be able to help us derive
insights into the carbonate chemistry dynamics of coastal regions that 
do not have the benefit of high-resolution models.

 Less stratified regions support stronger persistence of opportunist-type functional groups.

## Summary

1. Different regions of the Strait of Georgia have distinct, spatially cohesive biological signatures 
that coincide with changes in physical regimes.

2. Summer persistence of opportunist-type phytoplankton in the northern 
Strait of Georgia may be explained by stronger mixing due to lower freshwater input.  

4. Unsupervised machine learning methods provide simple, powerful techniques for finding structure
 in large datasets and determining boundaries of biophysical provinces.

Carbonate chemistry conditions similar to those in the Salish Sea are common throughout the Pacific Rim. 

---
name: tools

## Summary

1. On average, DIC has increased by 29-39 mmol m$^{-3}$ in the Salish Sea, causing a shift to majority aragonite undersaturation by volume.

2. Modern aragonite saturation conditions, though variable, are typically outside of the range of pre-industrial values throughout the domain. 

3. Much of the coastal Pacific rim has similar carbonate chemistry conditions, and comparable shifts in aragonite saturation may have occurred.

###A carbonate chemistry budget for the Salish Sea
<img style="width:63%"  src="./figures/fig_absbud.png"><br/>

--
In the Absolute DIC budget, which considers absolute movement of matter through the system, 
the fluxes of inorganic carbon through the system are dominated by movement through the Juan de Fuca lateral boundary.

###A carbonate chemistry budget for the Salish Sea
<img style="width:63%"  src="./figures/fig_delbud.png"><br/>

--
In the $\Delta$DIC budget view, which considers how much each flux changes the DIC content in the system, 
the Juan de Fuca lateral boundary remains a key source but is a less important sink, and other fluxes become more important.

###A closer look at the Juan de Fuca fluxes
<img style="width:90%"  src="./figures/dicflx_dp.png"><br/>

--

In the summer months, the incoming Juan de Fuca water is characterized by a strong, interannually consistent inflow of carbon-rich water
at depth.

--

Winter inflows and outflows are much less interannually consistent and merit further investigation.

###Air-sea CO$_2$ flux

We consider tendencies in surface pCO$_2$ and air-sea CO$_2$ flux in the context of the biophysical regions we found in Chapter 2.

###Air-sea CO$_2$ flux

<img style="width:55%"  src="./figures/pco2_clim.png"><br/>

--

Strong surface stratification drives low pCO$_2$ conditions in the Strait of Georgia, while in the Juan de Fuca Strait,
 tidal mixing of deep, carbon-rich waters leads to supersaturation - even in summer.

###Air-sea CO$_2$ flux

Most of the Strait of Georgia is neither a strong source nor a strong sink of atmospheric carbon. The Juan de Fuca Strait is a clear modest source.

###A projected near-future carbon increase

I estimate the future DIC intrusion by year 2050, using SSP 2-4.5,
a conservative (low) emissions scenario.

--
Remarkably, the projected increase over the next thirty years
represents approximately 80$\%$ of the total inorganic carbon increase 
from the pre-industrial period to year 2015!

Further measurable decreases in $\Omega_{arag}$ are visible under this scenario.

## Summary

1. The Salish Sea carbonate chemistry balance is largely 
set by the incoming water through the Juan de Fuca boundary at depth.

2. The carbon delivery by water is interannually 
consistent in summer but varies in winter.

3. Under a conservative, low-emissions scenario, the anthropogenic
 DIC increase in the Salish Sea in the next 30 years is ~80% of the total
 anthropogenic increase from the beginning of the industrial era.

##Research Questions

### Chapter 2

--

Carbonate chemistry conditions are influenced by interacting biological and physical processes. 

--

How do physical oceanographic dynamics drive phytoplankton community dynamics in the Salish Sea, and what are the dominant spatial patterns of both?

##Research Questions

### Chapter 3

--

How has anthropogenic carbon from the air-sea and open-ocean boundary changed the inorganic carbon mass-balance and cycling pathways in the Salish Sea?

--

What are the implications of this mass-balance change on $\Omega_{arag}$?

--

How do the carbonate chemistry conditions of the Salish Sea compare with available measurements in the rest of the global coastal ocean, and what are the implications of these conditions on $\Omega_{arag}$ globally? -->
