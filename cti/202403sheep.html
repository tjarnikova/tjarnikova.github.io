<h2> 2024-04-02 | March things </h2> 
<br>

A strange month. Some things:
<br><br> 
• I have a <a href= "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-6438.html">talk</a>
 accepted at EGU. Looking forward to science 
in the flat heart of Europe (and to riding share bikes 
and taking the metro in the wrong direction).
<br><br>
• Do you often make lots of experimental plots that need colour differentiation
 and are you simultaneously aesthetically opposed to the Python presets 
 (in which case welcome to our vaguely neurotic yet somehow lovely niche, 
 it’s nice here)? 
 <a href= "https://sashamaps.net/docs/resources/20-colors/">This</a> guy
  made a list of the 20 most distinct colours 
 (with options for colourblindness / accessibility).
<br><br>
• I went to see Dune, twice - probably the first time I’ve ever seen a film 
twice in cinemas — which led to rereading the book and relistening (predictably)
to 
<a href= "https://open.spotify.com/album/7HO6IZ3Ff5J9YoRBI8hm1O">this</a>
album, which I still find great. 
<br><br>
• As I probably say too often, my favourite Denis Villeneuve 
film remains
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4_s82xvQ80">Un 32 août sur terre</a>
- for fans of the desert, Montréal and absurd situations.
<br><br>
• V rámci již tradiční životní rubriky “obrozenci prosimvás” jsem se 
naučila nové krásné české slovo: <a href= "https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemogamie">větrosnubnost</a>. 
<br><br>
• For Easter holiday, I went alone by train to the North of Scotland and it was bracing and 
brilliant- wet socks, heather, sheep, mountains, wide cold suns, 
powdered macaroni and cheese (a pro tip: you can massively improve powdered 
macaroni and cheese very simply by just adding <i>more cheese of a different kind</i>; 
follow me for more gastronomic tips and tricks). I was offered a parrot by a granny 
named Maggie. She was serious. I’ve been well fond of sung the song Loch Lomond
 for years now but never thought much about the meaning, 
(which may be apocryphal). At least according to 
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKCbvbkEm_Y">this</a>
source, 
which I’m choosing to believe, it’s not a song about romantic love, 
 it’s a song about solidarity. Which is, of course, a form of love. 
 <br><br>
 • A really good accompaniment to long hours alone riding bikes (or equally folding laundry), 
 recommended by a friend that turns out to be a bit of a cult classic- 
 <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ZGEhsMB4tqPHoJLtbKA1U">the Blind Boy podcast</a>. 
 Softspoken, thoughtful meanders on various 
 topics by a man from Limerick. ADHD-vibes is an overused descriptor, but it is striking here. New episodes
 weekly. I enjoyed <a href= "https://www.huckmag.com/article/blindboy-boatclub">this</a> interview. 
<br><br>
» But I’m quite lucky, I feel like the curiosity that I was born with as a child never left me, 
so I get to experience wonder as a perpetual state of existence. However, I completely 
failed school and was fired from a job at a call centre for printing out 93 pages about 
CIA cocaine smuggling. This type of energy doesn't fly in most workplaces. 
You get labelled as eccentric fairly quickly. «
