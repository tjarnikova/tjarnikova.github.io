<h2> 2024-05 | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aghtla_VYsI"> Svítí, do oken mi svítí</a></h2> 
<br>
May has been a month of small-to-medium-sized domestic joys, flowers, and sun -- welcome, after a
long cold lonely <s>winter</s> spring. 
We all looked at the northern lights and took grainy pictures of them on our smartphone 
and put them on our little instagram accounts/sent them to our friends
& I thought it was great. 

<br><br>
• I finished a draft of a paper based on 
<a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-6438.html">{this}</a> talk. 
(It's an intermediate step, but so is everything except the last thing, 
so I had a negroni and an egg to celebrate, because, why not.)
<br><br>
• My friend wrote a neat paper on how many mammoths modern-day Northern Alaska could maybe support. 
Click on the mammoth to find out more! (TL;DR: 0.0–0.38 woolly mammoth / km2 (mean 0.13))<br><br>

• I spent a few days waffling about asking a question about a dataset because 
I assumed I was missing something first-order / it was trivial to ‘the community’. 
When I finally did, it turns out the answer was, whilst understandable, not obvious, 
and that moreover the number of people in the world who could answer it is definitely 
less than 10. A wholesome reminder.
<br><br>
• A less wholesome {but >= the first in terms of importance} reminder in the form
 of, among others, the self-satisfied retired engineer  who sat next to me on a plane: 
Don’t tell people who they are or what their problem is, 
unless they’ve explicitly asked you (this goes even if you know them well — perhaps doubly so).
<br><br>
• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWsjmtvIZA&t=1975s">Sasha Dolgopolov</a>
wrote their first stand-up in English. For fans of sardonic sensitive 
Russian punks (which I am). {Key words: feelings, faxes, fritz-kola, Alexei Navalny}
<br><br>
•I really liked the history of freedom podcast series with Lea Ypi (h/t J.J., ofc) --
(enough to figure out how to 
<a href="https://deepgram.com/learn/how-to-run-openai-whisper-in-command-line">transcribe</a>
it so that I could reread the 
bits I missed when zoning out doing the dishes):<br><br>

David Runciman: We now live in a world where that kind of speed has been franchised out to machines. 
It just has, and I don't think it's coming back. That kind of knowledge, the ability to access this space so 
that you can move in time with the pace of the information is so reliant now on machines which are 
themselves controlled by and dominated by the forces that you just talked about. And I don't think, 
my feeling is that this has escaped the story that we've talked about, which through the 20th century 
did make a lot of sense. We have escaped it and part of the reason that we've escaped it, 
I totally also get what you're saying that it's tracking one version of human reason, 
but that version of human reason that it is tracking has now acquired a life of its own. 
<br><br>
Lea Ypi: Fine, it has escaped. Is the escape irreversible or not?
Because if you think it's irreversible, okay, fine, let's close down the podcast, go home,
get drunk and wait for everyone to die. If you say it's reversible, the next question is,
what are you doing to reverse it? And that's the question that people need to ask themselves.«

 • I've spent enough time in the Canadian backcountry that I know the song  <i>The Mary Ellen Carter</i>, of course 
 {filed under "quasi-motivational songs feat fiddle and banjo that are about pulling a sunken ship from the 
 bottom of a harbour, which is both a metaphor and not; no notes"}. What I hadn't known was the story of the 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT-aEcPgkuA">guy</a> who
 kept himself alive when his boat sank in the north Atlantic in February 1983 by clinging to a lifeboat and yelling 
the lyrics to make it through the night. He survived, 
and some maritime regulations were amended to make aspects of seafaring safer. 
Something something victory of spirit over circumstance. And with every jar that hit the bar 
we swore we would remain, and make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
