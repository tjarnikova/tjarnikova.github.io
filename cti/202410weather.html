<h2> 2024-10 | Tell me what the weather's like so I don't have to go outside </h2> 
<br>
Things keep happening, time is like a river, etc. 
<br><br>
• D and M and I went to a talk by Robert MacFarlane, which I feel mixed about. On the one hand, if you haven’t
 read MacFarlane’s landscape writing, I really recommend it, because no one does it like he does. He takes unique
 vantage points, putting stones and paths and motorway service stations into unexpected spatiotemporal 
 contexts, genealogies of the words people use to make place, patterns in the mire. I first read Landmarks, about 
 the history of words about landscape, because LBC (who has great taste in basically everything) recommended it. 
 His latest book is Underland, about underground spaces, and he visits crypts and subterreanean physics facilities 
 and caves around the world. Everyone loved it, I did too. 
<br>
    So what’s the other hand? Maybe I am at my core a hater, but the whole evening felt less like a talk about literature 
and more like a celebration of Robert MacFarlane The Literary Hero (in hushed tones, the announcer explained that “Britain has no 
tradition of the public intellectual, but Robert MacFarlane is the rare exception”. Really? Great Britain has no 
tradition of the public intellectual? Who does, in that case?) and also a celebration of being the kind of person 
who goes to talk by Robert MacFarlane. At one point he said something like the point of art is to allow space for 
uncertainty, which is all very nice and a fair point, but sitting in a marquee on a literal country estate, surrounded by 
the type of cashmere-clad Briton who has never been uncertain about anything in their life, it felt a bit hollow. 
“Kitsch, of course, has no point”, proclaimed Robert solemnly, seemingly unaware that he had just gotten a room 
full of middle-aged listeners to chant the Latin name for corncrake <i>(Crex crex)</i> together to marvel at how it sounds 
like the stupid, endearing, endangered bird’s call. 
<br>
    Czech has the apt word sebedojímání, roughly translatable as a tendency to get self-sentimental, and I’m sure
 I’m both at points prone to it and allergic to it in others. But anyway, MacFarlane’s books are unrepeatable.
  We need the literary bois after all, even if we roll our eyes sometimes. 
<br><br>
• C and I went to see the Outrun, based on the book about Amy Liptrot, which is about alcoholism and solitude 
and the north of Scotland (and, incidentally, also a bit about corncrakes). It is intense, but I recommend it a lot. 
<br><br>
• A corncrake is <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10GlIo7_3uk">chřástal polní</a>, or something like ”field rattler”, 
in Czech, which is an artefact of the Czech National Revival, when we decided collectively as a nation that we did not 
need foreign words for things, thank you very much. (This is also how, while every language from Inuit to Swahili 
to Russian has a word for kangaroo that sounds roughly like kangaroo, Czechs have “klokan”, translatable roughly 
as “thing that jumps and starts with a k”, a fact I really like and that I think is somehow quite telling). 
<br><br>
• After years of haphazardly trying, I finally saw <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ff3fHS13FU">Spectral Wound</a>, 
which was excellent - an invigorating low rumble in the underbelly on a Thursday. I don’t live in the metal world
 basically at all but always enjoy my visits. (One of J’s other projects is writing 
essays about food, available in both 
 <a href= "https://invisiblepublishing.com/product/food-trembling/">book</a>
 and <a href= "https://invisiblepublishing.com/product/food-trembling/">blog</a>
 form, which I recommend without reservation.) 
 <br><br>
 • <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/xn_ze_ro/">Kit</a> and I resurrected our old project Dear Data, 
 when we sent each other post cards of data visualizations about 
our lives (based on 
<a href= "https://www.dear-data.com/theproject">this</a>
project by someone else). Maybe I’ll upload them sometime. Weird echoes: the same election, 
8 years later. Leonard Cohen had just died. Some things are very different, but I’m still listening to 
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU-RuR-qO4Y">this</a> and making plots of small things 
in my daily life. I first met Kit maybe a little more than 8 years ago, when they were doing a PhD on 
how oceanographers use computers (badly, it turns out -- no one ever told us how and yet here we are). 
I continue to delight in our Halley's-comet mutual orbit -- Kit's a font of rarely-matched creative output 
in both perspective and quality 
& also a person of remarkable wit and morals & just all in all a Good Egg. 
Cheers to the intermittent threads of friendship (and potentially sorry(-not-sorry) for the public love letter, K!)
<br><br>
I am not done this week's postcard yet, but here are all the small pre-work runs I’ve gone on this fall. 
Basically, I just run in circles around the cemetery:

<br><br>
We published a rather obscure (but, you know, interesting) paper 
<a href= "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL110225">paper</a>
about opal ballasting in the ocean.
<br><br>
• I visited the UK Met Office for a collaboration, which was really neat. It’s very much the birthplace of the whole field of
 numerical simulations of weather and climate, and maybe it’s my self-sentiment, but I’m always excited about this kind of thing.
  An infinitely complex world brought into varying levels of focus by generations of people working together as more than the sum
   of their parts - sense-making at all scales [něco něco mravenci vědy]. (I am not currently in the market for t-shirts with slogans on them,
    but if I were, I’d be tempted by 
    <a href= "https://www.presentindicative.com/products/the-shipping-forecast-veering-slowly-losing-identity-t-shirt-indigo">this</a> one, 
    inspired by the 
    <a href= "https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/shipping-forecast">shipping forecast</a>. 
  
    (There’s also a <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/61fn05IS5R9ugt5ECJanSb">podcast</a> of random shipping 
    forecasts , which I think a lot of people use for both sleep and anxiety.) 
    <br><br>
• A good song for commutes to the Met Office is <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu77nn6UKao">The Weather Song</a>, even if it’s a 
rather first-order association. It's a song that was a major landmark of the end of my time in Montréal, and it's somehow well over 10 years old now.  
Tim Darcy’s flat-affect seething has aged really well, I think, and is a good bracing for different climatic conditions of all sorts:
<br>
<br> 
<i>Tell me what the weather’s like // so that I don’t have to go outside <br> 

The limit's on the inside // and there's no inside at all <br> 
There's nothing keeping you from shouting out loud that <br> 
You believe in more than keeping time with life <br> 
</i>
<br>
(It was one of the very few things I used to own on vinyl, before I gave it to A, who, unlike me, owns a gramophone. (I have never owned a gramophone.))
