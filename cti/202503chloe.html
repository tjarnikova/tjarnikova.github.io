<h2> 2025-03 | Chloe has a half-pint of Guiness every time she goes to the pub </h2> 
<br>

<br><br>
A month of unreasonably interesting research-related travel in which took an overnight 
train a record five times in 30 days. (It would have been six, but the French found an 
unexploded bomb from the second world war in one of the Paris rail stations.) 
<br><br>
I went to a meeting in Edinburgh on tipping points in the climate system, and it was really nice
 - a fairly small, collegial group of people from ~15 countries, a set of lectures on interconnected 
 things, and lots of time to ask people about their work during generous coffee breaks. Quite a few of 
 the talks were about things I understood only vaguely. I’m routinely reminded that if you want to do 
 science, or any sort of sustained question-asking, you had better get very comfortable with feeling 
 quite confused a good amount of the time. I felt that way throughout most of my undergraduate degree, 
 which was in pure math, quite competitive, and in which I was competent on good days, 
 but definitely not among the best and brightest. The general atmosphere there was often an insecure 
 and miserable one. I think in general math can be prone to that sort of thing, maybe especially 
 in undergrad when people are very invested in their identity as Good At Math but not yet used to 
 the general confusion that accompanies a lot of research. This conference wasn’t like that, 
 partly because the array of topics was decently varied so there was no one person who understood everything,
 partly because the type of mathematicians who choose to study Hopf bifurcations in the climate system 
 instead of making a lot of money in the stock market tend to be some combination of nice and interesting. 
 The basis for a lot of the work discussed is
 <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429492563/nonlinear-dynamics-chaos-steven-strogatz">this book</a> 
  which has 19000 citations (!). Everyone I know who has read it really likes it — a well-written natural science novel, 
  but with equations. It presents quite complicated topics such that most interested readers can 
  get the rough contours of what is going on. Also, for anyone looking to apply extreme value theory 
  to their models/data, 
  <a href="https://comptools.climatematch.io/tutorials/W2D3_ExtremesandVariability/chapter_title.html">this tutorial</a>
  is really great (actually, a number of tutorials on that website are really great). 
  <br><br>
  I traveled far to see Laura Marling play a bare-bones set in Manchester as part of a 
  two-night sold-out run, which was quite special. 
  LM and I are similar ages and find ourselves at similar junctures, and I remember being 18 
  and being struck by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UkP1uB1nLU">this</a> for the first time. 
  I then sort of stopped paying attention for over a decade, so I revisited her music for 
  the first time again this spring laying on the floor of the balcony of the Albert Hall -- somewhere
  between recognition and newness, two hours of perfect, sparse-but-warm melody, a rare moment 
  of still focus.
  (She also writes a <a href="https://lauramarling.substack.com/">newsletter</a> 
  about creativity-music-literature-parenting that I 
  quite like.)
  <br><br>
  I finally read the Left Hand of Darkness, recommended by many queers/mountaineers over the years
  (that Venn Diagram has a refreshing amount of overlap, and I guess this book fits there too), 
  and now I also recommend it. 
  <br><br>
  In a professional context, I got asked "why don't we just geoengineer the climate?". 
  My response wasn't very articulate, in part because in my bubble of people who 
  study the climate system, I rarely meet anyone who considers geoengineering anything other than so
  extremely, stupidly dangerous as to be dismissible out of hand. Nevertheless, people are studying it, 
  so I should have an answer.
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/12/solar-geoengineering-uk">Here</a>
   is one of the best climate physicists in the world with his. 
   <br><br>
   Waiting for some train or other, I tried to  
   <a href="https://tjarnikova.github.io/cti/202503vague.html">articulate</a>
   the paralysis that many people I've talked to have been feeling lately. 
   (It's probably another thinly veiled rant about feeling helpless
   and no one owes me an audience; you've been warned.)
   <br><br>
   Related to paralysis and decision-making, I recommend the 
   <a href="https://ksen0.github.io/do-the-thing/index.html">latest interation</a> of Kit’s diagram 
   <i>Should I Do The Thing?</i>
   <br><br>
   Here is a dog we met on a bus in Edinburgh. Her name is Chloe. 
   Her (very nice) owner claims she gets a half-pint of Guiness every time she goes to the pub. 
   I believe it.

   The music video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb2q141rMNE">this</a>
  song is the opposite of new, but perfect. In the words of 
   someone on the internet: “could you imagine creating, at least once in your life, 
   something this purely beautiful and good".
