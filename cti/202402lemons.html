• AMOC  
• Following the modest success of January’s kimchi making operation, I fermented lemons, and in the process 
discovered that Sandor Katz’s bible The Art of Fermentation is 
<a href= "https://archive.org/details/TheArtOfFermentation/page/n259/mode/2up">{freely on the internet}</a>. 
I have since been putting fermented lemons in everything, up to and including scrambled eggs. 
It has been nice. “a special, mellow sourness with echoes of
an ancient world.” describes Katz. Indeed. <br><br>  
<br>
• At the Synth East festival, I
 saw a <a href= "https://vimeo.com/556036932">{documentary}</a> about Morton Subotnick, 
and in the process listened for the first time to
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HoljsO22qA&t=682s">{Silver Apples of The Moon}</a>,
which must have been an alien landing when it arrived. The film captures the sort of
 deep creativity that's really pleasant to just be in the company of, but also a time 
 when new technology felt genuinely exciting, when the future was a promise, when the very real 
 material externalities didn't yet literally crowd the horizon. 
 (Funny to think that music was written roughly at the same time as Roger Revelle wrote his 
 <a href= " https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1957.tb01849.x">{seminal 1957 paper}</a>
about carbon dioxide uptake in the oceans, whose abstract reads <i>The increase of atmospheric CO2 from 
  this cause is at present small but may become significant during future decades if industrial fuel 
  combustion continues to rise exponentially.</i> Annoying to be born at the end of the fuck around century
  and the start of the find out one; <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xr_nVyNMMY">{Модернизма больше нету.})</a>

 <br><br>  


• I saw a <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tei5VWlh26w">{Your Fat Friend}</a>, which was
tender and joyful and human and thoughtful and funny. Another way of being bodies in the world is possible!<br><br>  

• I walked across a few farmers' fields with the Norwich Right to Roam group, and I took some pictures. Cake, song,
starling murmurations, wide horizons. I am (slowly) learning to love the fens. <br><br>  

• Work sent me on a train to the Southwest, and so I took the weekend to bike over the windswept moors to
   Land’s End, which was lovely (if hilly - every single English village is at the bottom of a creek drainage, it seems). 
   On the way I passed the Blind Fiddler, which was a strange experience - something something 
   I rebuilt my bike's drivetrain.
